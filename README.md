# Burst Client

Burst is a Wurst fork designed for anarchy players and power-users. Check out the Trello board to see what I mean.

## vs Wurst
Wurst is can do everything, but its not good at anything. Its not designed around a specific style of MC gameplay like Future and ZeroDay are, and because of that the community calls it the "worst" (haha) client. This is true for skids, but the true value of Wurst comes from the fact that its:
  - Open source
  - Uses fabric (at the time of writting Liquidbounce is still on Forge)
  - implements an event system, click gui, tab gui, keybinding system, settings, ... basically 99% of a custom client
 
The reason for the fork is because I am changing and removing core parts of Wurst's base code that I don't think Alexander would be very happy merging. For example, certain features like excavator and tunneler are planned to be completly reworked to use Baritone instead since the cli8ent revolves around survival gameplay moreso.
 
Specific Burst modules may be ported over to Wurst.
 
Burst is the worst
