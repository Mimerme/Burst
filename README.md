# Burst Client

Burst is a Wurst fork designed for anarchy players and power-users. Check out the Trello board to see what I mean.

## vs Wurst
Wurst can do everything, but its not good at anything. This is sucks for skids, but the true value of Wurst comes from the fact that its the most up to date open source client out there (Currently Liquidbounce is still using Forge and only supports up to 1.12), and it already implements 90% of what a custom client needs. 
 
The reason for the fork is because I am changing and removing core parts of Wurst's base code that I don't think Alexander would be very happy merging. For example, certain features like excavator and tunneler are planned to be completly reworked to use Baritone instead since the Wurst's AI since this client is focused around survival gameplay, while Wurst's excels in creative.

The goal of Burst is to create a client that users can customize from top-to-bottom all during runtime. This means that everything from the UI, mods, and commands can all be customized while the game is running.
 
Specific Burst modules may be ported over to Wurst.
 
Burst is the worst
